Read a [blog post](http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html "Wait But Why") about procrastination. Learned about something called the Eisenhower Box (or as the blog author calls it the Eisenhower Matrix). It is a four quadrant box with Importance on the Y-Axis and Urgency on the X-Axis. You can become more productive by breaking your day, week, year, etc.. into tasks that fall in one of the four quadrants. Each quadrant is actionable in the following ways.

  1. Urgent and important tasks are to be done immediately
  2. Non-urgent and important tasks are to be scheduled to be done in the future
  3. Urgent and unimportant tasks are to be delegated to someone else
  4. Non-urgent and unimportant tasks are to be thrown away

Examples for each quadrant.

  1. Assignment from your boss
  2. Going to the gym
  3. Meetings with other people
  4. Browsing Reddit

There is also a website/app to help use the matrix. I haven't used the app so I cannot vouch for it. [Eisenhower.me](http://www.eisenhower.me/)
