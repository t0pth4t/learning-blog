Read a [blog post](http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html "Wait But Why") about procrastination. Learned about a something called the Eisenhower Box (or as the blog author calls it the Eisenhower Matrix). It is a four quadrant box with Importance on the Y-Axis and Urgency on the X-Axis. The idea being that urgent and unimportant things can be thrown out (or delegated to someone else). Important and non-urgent things can be planned for.
